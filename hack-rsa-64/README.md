to build the program type in the shell:
make
to execute:
make test

This program prompts a message on the terminal, user enters a plaintext of max 7 length, encrypts it with RSA 64, hacks it bruteforcing the prime factors of n, and calculating the inverse of e, and prints the hacked plaintext on the terminal.

NOTES: 

n is not more than 64 bits

plaintext (message) should be not more than 7 bytes.
