to build the program type in the shell:
make
to execute:
make test

This program can encrypt with RSA 64 a plaintext of at most 7 bytes, hack it bruteforcing the prime factors of n, and calculating the inverse of e.

NOTES: 

n should be not more than 64 bits

plaintext (message) should be not more than 7 bytes.

You may change the plaintext in the program to run different plaintext tests.
